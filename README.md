In this project, I along with my team members tried to analyse the climatology of tropical cylcone over the Bay of Bengal over 52 years time period(1972-2023). 

Objectives:

* To analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of tropical cyclones over the Bay of Bengal, identifying seasonal and monthly variation patterns.

* To analyze the seasonal and monthly spatial variation of genesis locations of tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal.

* To examine trends in cyclone frequency highlighting any significant changes.

* To assess the intensity of cyclones using metrics such as Maximum Sustained Wind (MSW), Minimum Sea Level Pressure (MSLP)
